Bugs in Structural Links.
-> if user scrolls scenes to outside, then link attached to triangle that symbolize structural link deattched weridly. 
   Maybe refresh process has bugs...

-> Found bugs. Structuralaggregator anchor's getLocation method returns relative coordinates from viewer, 
   but in anchor's getLocation method, it uses getBound method which returns absolute coordinates.
   to fix it, I have to get coordinate of viewer's left top to change absolute coordinates to relative coordinates,
   but how to do that..? I can't find document which describe how to get viewer object in figure object...

****** completed. use of viewport(to get Viewport, repeat draw2d's IFigure getParent() to find Viewport)
       and viewport.getLocation() to get Viewport's absolute coordinates, 
       then we can translate absolute coordinates to relative coordinates against view port.




Contain functionality has bugs. (contained link overdrawed at outside of containing object,
     and contained object hided in containing object if user moves containing object or resize containing object)


-> have bugs about container (with bendPoints. I have to fix it by altering moving commands to change it's bendPoints.)


List<OPMLink> linkList = childNode.getIncomingLinks(); 
		linkList.addAll(childNode.getOutgoingLinks()); 
		for(OPMLink link : linkList) { 
			List<Point> points = link.getBendpoints();
			if(points.size() > 0) {
				for (Point p : points) {
					p.setLocation(p)
				}
			}
		}
		childNode.getIncomingLinks();
